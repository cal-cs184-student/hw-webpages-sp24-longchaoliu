<h2 align="middle">Joy Liu and Rohan Mathur</h2>

<div>

<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>What we have done in this homework is build a baseline rendering system of shapes and textures in a way that allows the viewer to almost forget that they are viewing discrete pixels and helps them visualize continuous space. One interesting thing we learned completing the homework is that many functional solutions are quite inelegant. For example, requiring 6 line tests to see if a point is in a triangle feels excessive but is in fact necessary.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Section I: Rasterization</h2>
<p><strong>Walk through how you rasterize triangles in your own words:</strong><br>
First, we create a bounding box around the triangle by identifying the minimum and maximum height and width coordinates. For each point within this bounding box, we performed the point-in-triangle test in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions. We assigned points inside the triangle to Color in the sample buffer. 
</p>
<p><strong>Explain how your algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle:</strong><br>
Our algorithm did exactly that. We define a bounding box with the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the triangle and run line tests on all the pixels.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Walk through of supersampling algorithm and data structures/changes made to the rasterization pipeline:</strong>
  <br>
  In our supersampling algorithm, when rasterizing, we supposed we were rendering to a screen that’s sample_rate times bigger than the actual screen. In order to represent this, we adjusted the sample buffer to store sample_rate colors for each pixel. When we resolve to framebuffer, we average the pixels to depict them at our actual screen size. We also adjusted point and line rasterization to obey supersampling logic.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Why is supersampling useful?</strong>
  <br>
  Supersampling is useful because it captures gradations in color based on how much of a pixel contains a certain signal. Supersampling is a form of antialiasing, because by increasing the number of samples taken within each pixel, we are able to capture higher frequency information.

      <td>
        <img src="images/task2/01.png" align="middle" width="300px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Sample rate: 1 (no supersampling)</figcaption>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>
  <strong>How does supersampling antialias the triangles?</strong><br>
  With a sample rate of 1, we often fail to catch whether a pixel should have color as not. As the sample rate increases, we have a more fine-grained system of antialiasing that captures more high frequency information.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>
<p>
  <strong>How do barycentric coordinates work?</strong><br>
  Barycentric coordinates are essentially unit normalized triangular coordinates. The higher the coordinate value is for one of the corners, the closer the value is to that corner. So, the coordinates for the corners are (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), and (0, 0 ,1). On the triangle pictured below, you can see that at each corner of the triangle, the colors are completely either red, green, or blue. As you move away from the corners, the values for the other 2 coordinates increase and the color gets more blended. The very middle is an equal blend of the 3 colors, just as the coordinates would be (⅓, ⅓, ⅓).

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>
<p>
  <strong>What is pixel sampling? How did we implement it to perform texture mapping?</strong><br>
  We only encode texture information at certain locations in the texture map, but we need to convert the texture to the continuous pixel space. We do so by calculating the barycentric coordinates of the point within the triangle, and converting this to uv space. In uv space, we either round our point to the nearest uv coordinate, or we use bilinear interpolation to combine information from all four coordinates surrounding the point.

      <td>

      </td>

</div>

<p>
  <strong>Comparisons and relative differences:</strong><br>
  In this example, the red dotted line should be evenly spaced out. Without supersampling, with nearest pixel sampling, the red dotted line is clumped toward the right of the image, then disappears, and the signal is aliasing as a lower frequency dotted line. With bilinear pixel sampling, interpolation helps retrieve the original line, and it looks much more evenly spaced. 
  With supersampling, the difference is lessened, but the bilinear sampling dotted line still looks slightly straighter.
  <br>
  As seen in the example, bilinear sampling is slightly better than nearest sampling, but supersampling still provides the greatest performance increases. There will be the greatest if there are high frequency alternating stripes of color, because nearest sampling will only depict the colors at the uv coordinates, whereas bilinear sampling interpolates values so it can show a gradient.
</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>

<p>
  <strong>What is level sampling and how did we implement it?</strong><br>
  Level sampling is the idea that the closer something is to the camera, the more high frequency details should be depicted in the pixel space. By fixing the change (dx, dy) in pixel space and calculating the corresponding change in (du, dv) in texture space, if the texture vector magnitude is large, then we know that the image is close, and we should use a high resolution mip level, and vice versa.
  <br>
  <strong>We can now adjust your sampling technique by selecting pixel sampling, level sampling, or the number of samples per pixel. What are the tradeoffs between speed, memory usage, and antialiasing power between the three various techniques?
  </strong><br>
  <strong>Supersampling</strong> at rate k provides the highest antialiasing power, but it also requires the most time, O(kN), where N is the number of pixels. The space prerequisite is asymptotic in the size of the real image. The sampling process itself also requires O(kN) in memory.<br> 
  <strong>Level sampling</strong> requires the most memory–4/3 of the size of the real image to store all the mip levels. Sampling requires O(N) space and memory, plus a constant number of calculations for zero, nearest, or level sampling. The antialiasing effects are comparable to pixel sampling.<br>
  <strong>Pixel sampling</strong> is also asymptotic in the size of the real image, with sampling requiring O(N) space and memory, plus a constant number of calculations for nearest versus bilinear sampling.
